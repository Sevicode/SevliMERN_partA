## Project Description
This project is a MERN full-stack web application which we developed as a part of our Coder Academy Bootcamp assignments. In this project we worked in a team of two junior developers and developed an e-commerce store where users (custpmers) can sign in, buy and rate products. The seller is also admin and has full authorization to manage the website and make changes in the listings. 

## Purpose
*She Rydes* is a real world project and the client aims to bring a convenient and affordable place for people and specifically female customers to purchase their motorcycle riding appearal. 
## Functionality and Features
Our team have tried their best to integrate the client's requested features in the application as best as possible and meet theor expextations:

* Login/out and Signing up : a customer needs to sign in and if not previously signed up, they will have to sign up to be able to make a purchase, leave a comment or review a product.
* Admin pannel : the client/seller has the admin role and is fully authorized to make changes in the listings. 
* Search functionality: users can search for a specific product.
* Product Rating : customers can leave comments for the products they have purchased and rate them. A star rating system is designed so the customers can rate the purchased pproducts between 1-5 star. 
* User Authentication : Users need to be signed in either as a customer or admin/seller. This will be checked with authentication functionality already added to the application, including Front and Back-end use authentication and frontend profile. 
* Shopping card: customers can add products to their shopping card. 
* Payment systems
